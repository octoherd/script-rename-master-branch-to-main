## Maintainers only

### Merging the Pull Request & releasing a new version

Releases are automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
The following commit message conventions determine which version is released:

1. `fix: ...` or `fix(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps fix version, e.g. `1.2.3` â†’ `1.2.4`
2. `feat: ...` or `feat(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps feature version, e.g. `1.2.3` â†’ `1.3.0`
3. `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body (**Important**: commit body, not subject!): bumps breaking version, e.g. `1.2.3` â†’ `2.0.0`

Only one version number is bumped at a time, the highest version change trumps the others.
Besides publishing a new version to npm, semantic-release also creates a git tag and release
on GitHub, generates changelogs from the commit messages and puts them into the release notes.

If the pull request looks good but does not follow the commit conventions, use the <kbd>Squash & merge</kbd> button.
